### 👋 Hi, I'm Evance!

A polyglot and very experienced backend engineer interested in system programming. I speak many programming languages but try hard to focus on Rust, Golang, Javascript, and Zig. I am currently **looking for a job** while learning about system software by building them.


- I attended the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) programming retreat from 3rd-January to 21st-June.
- I helped build this modern search engine [Quickwit](https://quickwit.io/).
- At [eHealth Africa](https://www.ehealthafrica.org/), I developed and deployed public health monitoring systems, in the most constrained environments across Africa.
- I maintain a blog @ [evanxg852000.github.io](https://evanxg852000.github.io/)

**Interests:** Compilers - Search Engines - Database Systems · Distributed Systems
